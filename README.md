Userscripts to improve Discourse-based forums.

It started as a script that liked all posts on a page. I borrowed code from another open-source userscript to make it targetable. Click the toggle icon to set up auto-like on a user. From then on, any posts from that user will automatically be liked. Requires Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey.

Functions borrowed from the following:
